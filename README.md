# Reject-Inference-in-Credit-Scoring
Developed a reject inference framework to improve credit risk prediction for rejected applicants using historical loan data. 
Performed Good-in-Bad analysis to estimate potential risk profiles of rejected cases and integrated them into the training dataset for model enhancement. 
Utilized Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) in DAVinCI Labs to build and evaluate predictive models. 
Analyzed key financial features such as credit score, debt-to-income ratio, outstanding debt, and delay from due date, improving model robustness and fairness in credit approval decisions.
